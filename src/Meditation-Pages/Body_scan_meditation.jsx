            Body scan meditation is a powerful technique for reducing stress and promoting relaxation by bringing awareness to the sensations present in different parts of the body. To begin, find a comfortable position either sitting or lying down, and gently close your eyes if it feels comfortable. Start by taking a few deep breaths, allowing yourself to settle into the present moment.

            Begin to bring your attention to your feet. Notice any sensations you may feelâ€”tingling, warmth, or pressure. Without judgment, simply observe these sensations for a few moments before moving your attention to your ankles and calves. Continue to scan up through your legs, thighs, hips, and pelvis, noticing any areas of tension or tightness.
